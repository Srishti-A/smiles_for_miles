			<h2>Secret Identity : Bruce Wayne</h2>
				<img src="brucewayne.jpeg" alt="Bruce Wayne" id="image" height=400px width=300px/>
				<p>Batman's secret identity is <b>Bruce Wayne</b>, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises. 
				<br><br>Batman originated from an incident in Bruce's childhood; after witnessing the murder of his parents 
				<b>Dr. Thomas Wayne</b> and <b>Martha Wayne</b>,
				he swore vengeance against criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. 
				Bruce trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime.
				<br><br>He resides on the outskirts of <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_City" target="_blank">Gotham City</a></b> 
				in his personal residence, Wayne Manor. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his 
				family's fortune and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate.
				He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite.
				In public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid gossip. 
				A large assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery, including his nemesis, the Joker.</p>
